## Current Task: Home Page Enhancement
### Analysis
Current home page has basic structure with:
- Hero section with title and CTA
- Feature cards (3-column grid)
- How it works section (2-column grid)
- Static design with minimal visual appeal

### Enhancement Plan
1. **Visual Design System Updates** (150 LOC × 10 = 1,500 tokens)
   - Add gradient backgrounds and animations to CSS
   - Create plant-themed color variations
   - Add smooth transitions and hover effects

2. **Hero Section Enhancement** (100 LOC × 10 = 1,000 tokens)
   - Add background gradient or plant imagery
   - Implement animated elements (floating leaves, growing animations)
   - Enhanced typography with better visual hierarchy
   - Add statistics or social proof elements

3. **Interactive Feature Cards** (120 LOC × 10 = 1,200 tokens)
   - Add hover animations and micro-interactions
   - Include plant imagery or icons
   - Implement card depth with shadows and gradients
   - Add progress indicators or visual cues

4. **Additional Sections** (200 LOC × 10 = 2,000 tokens)
   - Plant gallery/showcase section
   - Testimonials or success stories
   - Plant care tips preview
   - Newsletter signup or community features

5. **Animation System** (80 LOC × 10 = 800 tokens)
   - Implement scroll-triggered animations
   - Add loading animations for better UX
   - Create plant-themed micro-animations

**Total Estimated Cost: 6,500 tokens**

**Execution Strategy:**
- Start with design system enhancements for consistent theming
- Focus on hero section for immediate visual impact
- Add interactive elements progressively
- Implement animations last for polish

## Discussions
- Using Supabase for backend services
- Implementing proper security with RLS policies
