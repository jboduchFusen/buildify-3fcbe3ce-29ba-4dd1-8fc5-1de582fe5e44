## Current Task: Home Page Enhancement
### Analysis
Current home page has basic structure with:
- Hero section with title and CTA
- Feature cards (3-column grid)
- How it works section (2-column grid)
- Static design with minimal visual appeal

### Enhancement Plan
1. **Visual Design System Updates** - CURRENT TASK
   - **Subtask 1.1: Enhanced Color Tokens**
     - Expand green palette with forest, sage, mint, and emerald variations
     - Add nature-inspired accent colors (earth tones, sky blues)
     - Create contextual tokens for success, growth, and vitality states
   
   - **Subtask 1.2: Plant-Themed Gradients**
     - Define leaf-inspired linear gradients (light to dark green)
     - Create radial gradients for organic, natural effects
     - Add sunset/sunrise gradients for hero backgrounds
     - Implement subtle texture gradients for depth
   
   - **Subtask 1.3: Animation Foundations**
     - CSS keyframes for growing/blooming effects
     - Floating and swaying animations for organic movement
     - Smooth transitions for hover states and interactions
     - Pulse animations for call-to-action elements
   
   - **Subtask 1.4: Enhanced Shadows & Effects**
     - Organic shadow variations with green tints
     - Glow effects for interactive elements
     - Depth layers for card components
     - Soft, natural border radius variations

2. **Hero Section Enhancement** - NEXT
   - Add background gradient or plant imagery
   - Implement animated elements (floating leaves, growing animations)
   - Enhanced typography with better visual hierarchy
   - Add statistics or social proof elements

3. **Interactive Feature Cards** - PENDING
   - Add hover animations and micro-interactions
   - Include plant imagery or icons
   - Implement card depth with shadows and gradients
   - Add progress indicators or visual cues

4. **Additional Sections** - PENDING
   - Plant gallery/showcase section
   - Testimonials or success stories
   - Plant care tips preview
   - Newsletter signup or community features

5. **Animation System** - PENDING
   - Implement scroll-triggered animations
   - Add loading animations for better UX
   - Create plant-themed micro-animations

**Execution Strategy:**
- Complete all design system subtasks before moving to components
- Test color contrast and accessibility with new tokens
- Validate gradient performance across devices
- Ensure animation performance is smooth on mobile

## Discussions
- Using Supabase for backend services
- Implementing proper security with RLS policies
- Clean component architecture with TypeScript
- Home page needs more visual appeal and engagement to attract users
